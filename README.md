# CMR2Decomp Project

This is a very feable attempt at Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 (PC) decompilation with the help of [reccmp](https://github.com/isledecomp/reccmp) from the Lego Island [isledecomp](https://github.com/isledecomp) folks.

This is being used to verify accuracy of functions/globals so far.

A lot more is known in Ghidra, it's just not been put into this actual source project yet. Right now this only compiles in Visual Studio 22 using the latest targeting via x86.

This will be far from accurate due to us using a newer compiler than that would've been used originally but at least from the [reccmp output]() you can see the important parts of these functions are there.
